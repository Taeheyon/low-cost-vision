This folder contains some projects that were created to determine
if python could be used to create testbench scripts. After some
experimentation, python was abandoned, because it took too 
much effort to create a link between C++ libraries and python 
programs. This meant that the main advantage of python over C++,
it being easier to program, was no longer valid, so it was 
decided to program everything in C++ instead.

So everything in this folder is essentially DEPRECATED
